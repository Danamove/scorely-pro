## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

### Production Settings
No environment variables required - all configuration is done through the UI.

### API Keys
- Users enter their own OpenAI API keys
- Keys are stored in localStorage
- No server-side configuration needed

### CORS Considerations
- Application uses OpenAI API directly from browser
- Ensure API keys have appropriate permissions
- No proxy server required

## üîç Testing Deployment

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] All files present and accessible
- [ ] CSS and JS files loading correctly
- [ ] Navigation between tabs working
- [ ] File upload interfaces functional
- [ ] Form interactions responsive
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design verified

### Post-deployment Testing
1. **Functionality Test**:
   - Upload a sample CSV file
   - Navigate through all tabs
   - Test form inputs and toggles
   - Verify export functionality

2. **Performance Test**:
   - Check page load speed
   - Test on different devices
   - Verify responsive design
   - Check browser compatibility

3. **API Integration Test**:
   - Enter API key in settings
   - Test ranking simulation
   - Verify error handling

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

**Files not loading**
- Check file paths are relative
- Ensure folder structure is maintained
- Verify case sensitivity (css/ not CSS/)

**Netlify build fails**
- Ensure netlify.toml is present
- Check build command is empty
- Verify publish directory is "."

**GitHub Pages not updating**
- Check Actions tab for build status
- Ensure main branch is selected
- Wait a few minutes for propagation

**HTTPS mixed content errors**
- Ensure all resources use HTTPS
- OpenAI API uses HTTPS by default
- Check for any HTTP links

### Performance Optimization

**For Large Deployments**:
1. Enable compression in netlify.toml
2. Optimize images (if any added later)
3. Minify CSS/JS for production
4. Use CDN for external libraries

**Caching Strategy**:
- HTML: No cache (dynamic updates)
- CSS/JS: Long cache (version in filename)
- Configure in netlify.toml

## üìä Analytics Setup (Optional)

### Google Analytics
Add to `<head>` in index.html:
```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
</script>
```

### Netlify Analytics
- Enable in Netlify dashboard
- Provides server-side analytics
- No code changes required

## üîê Security Headers

Already configured in netlify.toml:
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues during deployment:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Verify all files are present and correctly named
3. Test locally before deploying
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Contact support with specific error messages
